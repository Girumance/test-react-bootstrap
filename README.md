# test-react-bootstrap

* Create a new ReactJS project using create-react-app
* Use react-bootstrap for styling
* Use react-router-dom to create a single page app
* Create pages for Home, About, Contact Us
* Create routes for each of the three pages
* Create a common navigation bar component placed at the top of all the pages that contains links to all three pages
* Make it so that the navigation bar becomes a menu that pops out from the right side of the page when the screen size is "xs" (see bootstrap offcanvas example)
* The home and about pages can just have a "jumbotron" type image (any sample image is fine) and then a few paragraphs of some "lorem ipsum" text inside of a responsive container
* The contact us page should have a form that requests the user to enter their name, email, and some message text, with a submit button. On form submit it should just display the form data as JSON in a popup modal.
